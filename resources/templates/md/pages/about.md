mcpatella is an independent programmer who spends most of her time working on the live-coded Clojure screencast series Doing Computers.

Coding is really terrible, but programming and computation don't have to be. So she's also working on alternatives to code, with side projects in data science, interactive software experiences (gamedev), and web development.

I think all programmers ought to watch Bret Victor's [The Future of Programming](https://vimeo.com/71278954). You can see the rest of Bret's public work at [http://worrydream.com](http://worrydream.com).
